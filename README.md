# Signum Motors

This is a website created for Signum Motors, business dealing with repair and restoration of vehicles. Part of this website will be informational, explaining the type of services offered and location, opening times, etc. The other part of this website will be dedicated to help in navigation through their YouTube channel - kind of an organised list of contents, more organised than on YouTube directly, at least.

## Landing page

Here we will see intial information about the business with some graphics showing past and current projects. The page design is responding to the user device's resolution, to present the information in a readable and easily accessible manner.

## Navigation

The navigation menu is provided on the right hand side, it is device responsive, so will alter the displayed page depending on the user device's resolution. It will help to provide user with the best possible user experience and make it easy to access information and navigate through the website content.
